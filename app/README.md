# Flask Pipeline Project
To summarize, you'll build a Docker image for the Flask app using the Dockerfile in the app/ directory. The MySQL database container will be created based on the official MySQL image specified in the docker-compose.yml file.

When you run docker-compose up from the database/ directory, Docker Compose will build the Flask app image using the Dockerfile in the app/ directory, and it will pull the MySQL image and create the database container based on the docker-compose.yml file.
